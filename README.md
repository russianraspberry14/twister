## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Twitter (Now X): fantastic color scheme for dark mode, can download pictures on the spot and allows easy sharing.
- Forest (Timer Pomodoro App): Although glitchy, coverts working into a gameplay, easy on the eyes, simple UI
- Reddit: Thread system allows multi layered conversations to be displayed in a simplified way, Like the upload post format and the award system

If I were to make some improvements, I would like to make major improvements to the Forest since it is very glitchy. I would improve the way that the trees are displayed and also improve the animation and maybe change the fonts of everything to make it more easy onn the use than it already is.
